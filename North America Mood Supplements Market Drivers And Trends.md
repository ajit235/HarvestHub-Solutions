Increasing incidences of stress, anxiety, and depression have led individuals to seek natural alternatives to support emotional well-being. Additionally, the shift towards self-care and holistic health practices has boosted the consumption of supplements that promise enhanced mood, reduced stress, and improved cognitive function. As people move away from prescription medications due to side effects, natural mood supplements are gaining popularity as safer, more accessible solutions for mental health support.</p><p>Another significant trend in the North American mood supplements market is the rising adoption of plant-based and organic products. Consumers are becoming more health-conscious and prefer supplements made from natural, non-synthetic ingredients. This has led to the emergence of mood supplements featuring botanicals like ashwagandha, valerian root, and St. John’s wort. Moreover, advancements in research and product innovation have resulted in more effective mood-boosting formulations, contributing to the market’s growth. The increasing number of people opting for sustainable and environmentally friendly products further supports the expansion of the mood supplements industry in the region.</p></p><blockquote id="" class=""><strong>Download Full PDF Sample Copy of @&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verifiedmarketreports.com/download-sample/?rid=412362&utm_source=GitHub-Jan&utm_medium=265" target="_blank">North AmericaMood Supplements Market Report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></blockquote><h3 id="" class=""><strong>Global&nbsp;North AmericaMood Supplements Market Size And Forecast</strong></h3><pre class="reader-text-block__code-block"><strong>Mood Supplements Market size was valued at USD 4.5 Billion in 2022 and is projected to reach USD 7.9 Billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 7.5% from 2024 to 2030.</strong></pre><h3 id="" class="">Leading Players in the&nbsp;North AmericaMood Supplements Market</h3><h3 class=""></Li><Li>LONZA</Li><Li> Abbott Laboratories</Li><Li> Amway Corporation</Li><Li> DSM</Li><Li> DuPont</Li><Li> GNC</Li><Li> Herbalife</Li><Li> Merck</Li><Li> Nature's Sunshine</Li><Li> Nestle S.A.</Li><Li> Now Food</Li><Li> Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.
